## Instructions
In command line:
1. make
2. java sim_cache <BLOCKSIZE> <L1_SIZE> <L1_ASSOC> <L2_SIZE> <L2_ASSOC> <REPLACEMENT_POLICY> <INCLUSION_PROPERTY> <TRACE_FILE>

Debug: java sim_cache 16 1024 2 0 0 0 0 traces\gcc_trace.txt 
Test: java sim_cache 1 16 4 32 4 0 0 traces\test_trace.txt



## TODO
PDF report



## Policies
Replacement:
- LRU (0): Replace block that was least recently touched.
- FIFO (1): Replace block that was placed first in cache.
- Optimal (2): Replace block that will be needed furthest in the future.
Inclusion:
- Non-inclusive (0): L2 includes L1, but not strictly.
- Inclusive (1): L2 must include all of L1. If a block in L2 is evicted, do the same for L1 (if it exists).



## Requirements
The output from your simulator includes the memory hierarchy
configuration and trace filename, the final contents of all caches, and all
required measurements.

The output from your simulator matches EXACTLY both the formatting
and numerical values of the posted validation runs. The only exception is
that you are permitted a variable amount of whitespace (tabs and
spaces), although newlines must match (i.e., no extra lines).

You explicitly confirmed that your outputs match EXACTLY (except for
tabs and spaces) the posted validation runs, by running the command
“diff –iw …” as explained in the spec.

You can just type “make” to build your simulator (via your Makefile)

The simulator built by the Makefile actually runs correctly (some students
introduce the Makefile at the last minute and don’t actually test the
simulator version built by it – don’t make this mistake)

The compiled simulator is called “sim_cache”

Your simulator “sim_cache” takes in arguments as specified in the spec:
sim_cache
<BLOCKSIZE> <L1_SIZE> <L1_ASSOC> <L2_SIZE> <L2_ASSOC>
<REPLACEMENT_POLICY> <INCLUSION_PROPERTY> <trace_file>

Your simulator prints output to the console (i.e., screen) only

You have been vigilant about taking certain precautions: keeping backups,
not touching files after the submission deadline (to keep timestamps
valid, just in case we need to revisit the original files), etc.

Submit only a single zip file

The name of your submitted zip file is “mp1.zip”

The size of your submitted zip file is less than 1MB (if you need to go over
by a little bit, keep it reasonable.)

Include all the necessary files in your mp1.zip submission:
* Source code files
* Makefile
* Report called “report.pdf”

Report is named “report.pdf” (PDF)

Report consists of the provided cover page (with your name, signed
Honor Pledge, etc.) and required content as explained in the spec.
